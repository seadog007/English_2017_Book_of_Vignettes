							<h1>Download/Upload</h1>
							<p align="justify">On that day, It is the biggest competition in my life. The game is called Capture The Flag. In a war, people capturing others flag for showing their victory, but it also applies to the virtual world - the Internet. We started the competition for the whole day. It’s long period like a river of time, which keep flowing from the infinity to the negative infinity. Within the river, there are hundreds of people who trying to strive for the best, but finally, only one person can reach the infinity. The routes to each question are like trees, which may grow during people developing another way to solve the question. Instantly, the scores of each team climb up like ants. In that day, people create lots of traffic for trying to solve questions like the water flood flow straight through the server. After the competition, I think I got a lot. Lots of invisible experience, suddenly, I feel I am the character in the video game, fighting with monsters, and gaining the experience with the “Ding Ling” sound. With the flow of time river, finally, I got the second place. I appreciate people who recommend me to join the competition. They even change the rules a little bit to let high school students join. I thank them a lot.</p>

							<h1>Gaming Time</h1>
							<p align="justify">When I was little, my favorite game is Bubble Bobble. It is a arcade game, and then transfer to computer. I kind of remember it is the time of Windows XP published, and it is a 8-bits style game since the graphics card is not that good at the time. There are lots of level in the game, and each level have different terrain and monster. Monsters are running toward to you like tsunami. The game also has lots of different bubble, and they randomly generate on the battlefield. It is the favorite game from my childhood because it is the first game I play ever. It is fun and peaceful relative to the other games published recently. The game brings to me lots of memory of my brother because we play together almost every time. In the game, my brother and me can practise our playing skills over and over again, but it is annoying for playing again and again since we need to start over the game after both players died. The game is a black hole of time, which will drill your time before other people notice you. I stop playing the game after once I reinstall the operating system, and the gone forever like wind, which doesn’t leave any track.</p>

						<div class="inner">
							<h1>Humanity Country</h1>
							<p align="justify">My home town, Taiwan, is the place that have full of humanity. I think Taiwan is a great place since you can make friends very easily. The rank of difficulty of making friends is easiest in the world. Comparing to other big countries, I think it is a honer for saying I am come from Taiwan, and it also make people feel you are friendly. Taiwan is a good country that most place in Taiwan have special foods like Japan, but I still think the most important things of Taiwan is the humanity. It is the air surrounding of Taiwan, blow into everyone’s heart. Every time when our country have huge disaster, people will help each other for passing the hard time. I think our country is filled with the humanity, but comparing to Japan, I think they did better on it, so I think we really should improve our humanity like we built the Taipei 101, so we can stand in every disaster. Every morning, I see lots of social news, then I think “why majority of people sacrifice minority people’s right for making their life better” because I think people should be helping each other, instead of persecute each other. If our society want to be a country like Utopia, then we should helping each other.</p>

							<h1>The Forbidden Secrets</h1>
							<p align="justify">Lots of test and quizzes coming everyday in our school, and our test is not all at the same time, so people who finished the test first will tells the people who not taking the test - basically, it is cheating. I think people often do that everyday, and other people think that is unfair and also it is pretty hard to catch even though people talking about the quiz in front of teachers since most of our teacher didn’t understand Chinese at all. There was once that we have a physics test, and our teacher tell us not to share the test with others. Even telling people the difficulty of the test is not acceptable, but some of the student didn’t follow the direction, and tells the other block. Finally, our teacher notice that, and he is pretty upset and a little bit angry about it. It is like the death penalty of the trust between teacher and us, then we realize how serious is it. Even the trust is like a broken bridge which destroyed by the flood, but we still can rebuild it through the promise between teacher and us. So we have a deal with our teacher, then it never happened again, but I think the method only works when the relationship between teacher and us is good, otherwise people won’t care about teacher’s feeling, which is a good news because it can provide that the relationship between the teacher and us is good.</p>
